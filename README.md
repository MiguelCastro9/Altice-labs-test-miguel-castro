<strong>Back-end</strong>

Import the project into an IDE of your choice, the IDE used for development was IntelliJ IDE, then simply build the application with the command <code>mvn clean install -U</code> to download the dependencies that are managed by Maven, 
and run the application with the command <code>./mvnw quarkus:dev</code> and the command <code>./mvnw test</code> to run the tests. When the application is running, to view the application documentation created by Swagger UI, access <code>http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/</code>

<strong>Front-end</strong>
